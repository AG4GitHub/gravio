This is very much a work in progress.

Gratrain is a simple graph generator.

Generation follows a pipeline

1) Graph data may be authored in Jsonnet
2) Compiled to JSON
3) Loaded by Python into Networkx objects
4) Saved into final form (ie, GraphViz dot)

The name is a play on "Jsonnet", "graph" and "train" (pipeline).
